# Angular Practice with MohamedYoussfi Demo
This repository contains my first Angular practice project, based on the demo created by MohamedYoussfi. It serves as a learning exercise for me to understand and apply Angular concepts.

### Description
In this project, I have followed the tutorial/demo provided by MohamedYoussfi to build a basic Angular application. The demo showcases various Angular features and best practices, helping me gain hands-on experience with the framework.

This project was generated with Angular CLI version 15.0.0.

### Development server
Run ng serve for a dev server. Navigate to http://localhost:4200/. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

### Code scaffolding
Run ng generate component component-name to generate a new component. You can also use ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module.

### Build
Run ng build to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the dist/ directory.

### Running unit tests
Run ng test to execute the unit tests via Karma.

### Running end-to-end tests
Run ng e2e to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

### Further help
To get more help on the Angular CLI use ng help or go check out the Angular CLI Overview and Command Reference page.
